    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
           <p>	 The web, in the early days was learning a lot of code in order to do anything,
          including web design.  The tools were there, but the way they were used was laborious and insufficient.
          It took a lot of time for designers and processing power.  By simplifying visual elements and adding
          New elements streamlined the process and add new elements.  Which makes it easier to produce better content.
          Eventually designers wonâ€™t even know what codes do what and they will just focus on making thing that look,
          run and operate seamlessly.
